## About project

The website serves as a mirror for downloading maps for the osu! game. It also provides an extended library of maps, including those that may have been removed but were once legendary and missed by some players.

## Tasks I completed on this project

- Updated all branding, including vector logo design;
- Added a section for filters based on map statistics, which was not available on the official osu! website;
- Worked with components, variants, auto-layouts;
- Created responsive design for desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile
- Improved the User Flow, allowing for a better map download experience than the original osu! site;
- Developed a design system to facilitate front-end work and ensure typography and many components were consistent;
